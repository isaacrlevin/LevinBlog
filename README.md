# Isaac Levin's Blog

Hugo Generated Static Site hosted in Azure Blob Storage that runs https://www.isaaclevin.com. This site is built using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to build the site with Hugo and deploy it out. Check out how I do it [here](https://github.com/isaacrlevin/LevinBlog/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+and+Publish+Blog+to+Azure+Blob+Storage%22)
