Hi, my name is Isaac Levin, and I am a .NET Developer Advocate at Amazon Web Services as well as Microsoft MVP living in Woodinville, WA. My emphasis in the developer space is primarily centered around .NET, .NET Core, and front-end technologies like Node.js and Angular. I have always been interested in things beyond the horizon, and my eyes lit up when I first started reading into Cloud Computing and how we can extend our reach by leveraging technologies not only maintained by large organizations but the Open Source Community as well. I have worked in various industries such as financial services, marketing, education, real estate, and most recently beverage.
<br />
<br />

On the personal side, I am husband to an amazing wife, and father to 2 amazing boys. My non-work related life is centered around spending time with my family, running 4-5 times a week watching as much TV as I can get my hands on, and playing guitar terribly.
