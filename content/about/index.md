Hi, my name is Isaac Levin, and I am an Application Development Manager working for Microsoft in the Developer Support Organization.I am a Microsoft Certified Azure Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer, Azure Developer, Solutions Developer, Solutions Engineer and Solutions Associate living in Norwalk, CT. My emphasis in the developer space is primarily centered around .NET, .NET Core, and front-end technologies like Node.js and Angular. I have always been interested in things beyond the horizon, and my eyes lit up when I first started reading into Cloud Computing and how we can extend our reach by leveraging technologies not only maintained by large organizations but the OSS as well. I have worked in various industries such as financial services, marketing, education, real estate, and most recently beverage.
<br />
<br />

On the personal side, I am husband to an amazing wife, and father to 2 amazing boys. My non-work related life is centered around spending time with my family, running 4-5 times a week watching as much TV as I can get my hands on, and playing guitar terribly.
