Hello there,

<br />

So my name is Isaac, and I am blogging now, thanks for stopping by. Why am I doing something that literally everyone is doing? I guess you can say it was caused by my trip to Microsoft Build 2017. Throughout my career, I have built LOB apps. This usually doesn't give the oppurtunity to use the latest and greatest tech and tools. After seeing all the fun stuff going on in the Web ecosystem, I decided I wanted to be more invloved. I have learned a few interesting things and I want to share them with anyone that comes across this place. Hopefully it will lead people to share thier interests and knowledge as well.....

<br />

Take care,

<br />

Isaac
