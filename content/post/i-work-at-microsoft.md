## New Beginnings

<br />

I have accepted a position to join Microsoft in the Premier Services Division. My role will be Application Development Manager (ADM) and I will be responsible for helping our customers reach their full potential using Microsoft Tools and Resources. I am immensly excited to start this journey and continue to grow as a developer/technology enthusiast.

<br />

For a software developer, one who focuses on .NET, C#, and other goodness on the web, Microsoft is where the magic happens. For me to be able to be a small part of that magic making mechanism is incredibly humbling and I am so grateful to all the people who have helped me in reaching this moment.

<br />

## Meant to Be?

<br />

I was going through a box of old stuff from high school and college and came across this "goals" list that I was tasked with creating when I was a Senior in high school in 2004. Forgive my terrible handwriting, it has gotten much worse.

If you can read that mess, it basically says in a year I would be going to college for a Computer Science Degree (ended up with MIS, so similar), and in 10 years I would be working in Microsoft doing "Software Management" whatever that means. Needless to say, even over 10 years ago, I knew what I wanted to do, and even though it is late, I am sticking to my script.
